Title: Distinct Colours Palettes Based on 'iwanthue'
Description: Creating effective colour palettes for figures is 
    challenging. This package generates and plot palettes of optimally 
    distinct colours in perceptually uniform colour space, based on 
    'iwanthue' <http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/>. 
    This is done through k-means clustering of CIE Lab colour space, 
    according to user-selected constraints on hue, chroma, and 
    lightness.
